### Logging with parameters

You can write `Log::info()`, or shorter `info()` message with additional parameters, for more context about what happened.

```php
Log::info('User failed to login.', ['id' => $user->id]);
```

### Log Long Running Laravel Queries

```php
DB::enableQueryLog();

DB::whenQueryingForLongerThen(1000, function ($connection) {
     Log::warning(
          'Long running queries have been detected.',
          $connection->getQueryLog()
     );
});
```

### Benchmark class

In Laravel 9.32 we have a Benchmark class that can measure the time of any task.

It's a pretty useful helper:
```php
class OrderController
{
     public function index()
     {
          return Benchmark::measure(fn () => Order::all()),
     }
}
```

### More convenient DD

Instead of doing `dd($result)` you can put `->dd()` as a method directly at the end of your Eloquent sentence, or any Collection.

```php
// Instead of
$users = User::where('name', 'Taylor')->get();
dd($users);
// Do this
$users = User::where('name', 'Taylor')->get()->dd();
```

### Log with context

New in Laravel 8.49: `Log::withContext()` will help you to differentiate the Log messages between different requests.

If you create a Middleware and set this context, all Log messages will contain that context, and you'll be able to search them easier.

```php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
{
    $requestId = (string) Str::uuid();

    Log::withContext(['request-id' => $requestId]);

    $response = $next($request);

    $response->header('request-id', $requestId);

    return $response;
}
```

### Quickly output an Eloquent query in its SQL form

If you want to quickly output an Eloquent query in its SQL form, you can invoke the toSql() method onto it like so

```php
$invoices = Invoice::where('client', 'James pay')->toSql();

dd($invoices)
// select * from `invoices` where `client` = ?
```

### Log all the database queries during development

If you want to log all the database queries during development add this snippet to your AppServiceProvider

```php
public function boot()
{
    if (App::environment('local')) {
        DB::listen(function ($query) {
            logger(Str::replaceArray('?', $query->bindings, $query->sql));
        });
    }
}
```
